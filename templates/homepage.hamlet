<h1>Welcome to CarrierPigeon!

<p>Today's landscape of web and mobile applications implicitly forces users to be "always-on" more than ever. Emails demand prompt responses, text messages require instant replies, and social media notifications and updates are a constant source of distraction. While real-time communication certainly has its place, we at CarrierPigeon believe that the creation of this world of expected instantaneity has been at the cost of long-form, thoughtful communication.
<p>CarrierPigeon is a new kind of messaging application, designed from the ground up to encourage the sort of traditional correspondence that has silently slipped away. When you sign up for CarrierPigeon, you choose which day of the week your Pigeons will be delivered to you; similarly, when you send a Pigeon, you do so with the understanding that your recipient might not receive it for several days, and that no immediate response is required.
<p>So get started with CarrierPigeon now by signing up! Or take your time and sign up later...after all, isn't that the point?
